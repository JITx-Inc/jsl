# PCI-e Example Code

This example illustrates how to utilize the PCI-e helper functions available in JSL.

# Setup

1.  Clone this library (you likely did that to see this file).
2.  Open the root of the JSL directory in VSCode.
3.  Navigate to the `examples/protocols/pcie` directory.
4.  Open the `pcie-main.stanza` file in VSCode.


# Running the Example

To run this example, you need to run `pcie-main.stanza` by entering `<CTRL> Enter` while in that file.
Running the code will result in a layout which can be edited to position the two ICs as well as the 4 pairs of blocking capacitors.
