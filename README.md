# JSL - Jitx Standard Library

This library is intended to be a companion library to the
JITX environment. The goals for this project are:

1.  Provide a focused API that supports PCB development.
2.  Expressive, consistent interface that makes defining components and circuits easy.
3.  Maintainable and distributable library with the help of [SLM](https://github.com/StanzaOrg/slm).
4.  Well-documented and thoughtful explanations.
